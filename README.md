# Rock Bot

Rock Bot is a group project for the CSCI 191T Game Development course at CSU Fresno. For this project, we had to create our own game engine using C++ and multiple libraries. The project was done using the Code::Blocks IDE and this repo contains a .cbp file that can be used with Code::Blocks. All libraries should already be linked properly in the .cbp file using relative paths.

## Getting Started

Download the zip file from this repo and extract it. All the project files are inside the "Engine" folder. If you want to distribute the program without all the source code, you can zip up the Engine/Release folder, which contains an executable and the necessary folders and dll files for the program to run.

### Prerequisites

If you wish to modify and compile the code, you'll want to use Code::Blocks IDE with MinGW 32-bit. You can get the project to work in other IDE's, such as Visual Studio, but you'll have to link the libraries yourself.

The program will only run on Windows operating systems. Currently it has only been tested on Windows 10 64-bit environments. Considering how old some of the libraries are, I would assume the project could run on older versions of Windows too.
